# Sudoku_with_GUI
Read Me

This is a sudoku game that I created from scratch with a graphical user interface that I implemented from tkinter. 
You input values into the grid by clicking the respective button, then the entry line, and hit confirm value.
The program has several features beyond that including a recursive solving algorithm.
Much of the code in Sudoku_Game.py is not used in the final program since I developed that before I decided to make a GUI.
Finally, I used PyInstaller to convert all the code into a clickable desktop icon (hence why the puzzles are stored in a list instead of a .txt file).
The text file for the puzzles is provided and that could be used instead of the .py file with a few tweaks to the code.

his was a beginner project to get used to classes and Tkinter.
